    I've also outlined them here:

    D file          - Delete the named file.
    E comment       - Echo; display comment on screen followed by a new line (multiple spaces/tabs may be reduced to a single space); if no argument simply issue a new prompt.

    L               - List the contents of the current directory; see below.

    W               - Wipe; clear the screen.
    X program       - Execute the named program. This will be a file with a .o or .out file extension.
